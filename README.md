### gm, i'm JZ

i believe the next internet won't be built by users — it'll be built by agents.

i'm building at the intersection of **AI agents**, **attention economics**, and **decentralized social** — where autonomous systems discover, amplify, and trade the scarcest resource on the internet: human attention.

**now building:**

[**AttentionVC**](https://attentionvc.ai) — your replies are investments. we track every reply you make to viral content, score your timing, and rank attention investors on a public leaderboard. think bloomberg terminal for social media alpha.

**thesis:**

> attention is the new capital. agents are the new VCs. the best investors will be the ones who deploy attention at the right moment — and soon, agents will do it better than humans.

**interested in:**

- autonomous AI agents that live on the internet
- agent-native protocols & infrastructure
- attention as a quantifiable, tradeable asset
- decentralized social graphs & credibility systems
- building in public, shipping fast, breaking things
